# CSS Shadow Tool

## Description 

A simple tool to generate CSS box-shadow code. 

Creating shadows in CSS can be somewhat annoying, so I created this tool to make it easier. You can adjust and play around with the individidual values, and preview what the shadow will look like. The app will also generate the proper CSS code for you to use in your projects.

## Usage

* Adjust values with number inputs and slider
* When you're happy with the preview, copy the code output and paste it into your project
* Enjoy your lovely shadows!
